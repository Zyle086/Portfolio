Simple Portfolio Website Design #1

This is my first ever portfolio website

It contain/will contain the following:
1. Home page - Introductions and related picture/s
2. Skills section - valuable skills we acquired along the way
3. Portfolio section - collection of my best projects
4. Contacts section - Self explanatory
 
No pressure but the website should look modern and simplistic while being concise. Add animations (optional)(someday)
Focus on learning and familiarizing the basics of Html and Css with this portfolio
Learn some Javascript while I'm at it.


This project will take a while. Like a while a while. No rush, better to learn every nokk(typo but lol) and cranny of the concepts than rushing everything. 
(I SAY THIS AND I MEAN IT, THE HEADER ALONE TOOK 2 DAYS, LEARNING ALL 3 LANGUAGES AT ONCE IS EQUIVALENT TO MIND BREAK(IYKYK).

Idk how to add images here yet(Not planning to learn anytime soon, learn the 3 foundation languages of website first)
